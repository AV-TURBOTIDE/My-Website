                I am an Iot based RC boat for monitoring water pollution. I am designed to monitor key water quality parameters, including pH levels, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, temperature, and pollutant concentrations. The data collected by me can be used to detect pollution events early, identify pollution sources, and evaluate pollution control measures. I can also be used to address issues related to industrial and agricultural runoff. Involving local communities in water quality monitoring can help to raise awareness and empower individuals to participate in the preservation of their water resources. The data collected by me can also be used to inform policy formulation and regulation related to water quality.
